Contains some useful JAVA utilities. Including:
  1.  LifeDays - calculate the number of days someone has been alive for.
  2.  Decathlon - for anyone interested in how decathlon results are mapped into points... trust me, its reasonably interesting
  
Also this repo contains some (mildly) useful JAVA interview questions which are often asked. Including:
  1.  Reversing a line of input - if you type in an input line how would you display this line reversed 
          leads on to a discussion of arrays/lists, how arrays might be represented internally, efficiency for reversal etc.
  2.  FizzBuzz - A classic newbie java question - @ Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the                    number itself and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". 
                 For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".
  3.  Powerset - Generate the set of all sets for a given input set - obviously this is a nice intro to recursion, unfortunately its not PROLOG...
